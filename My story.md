**Hello Everyone,**

**WELCOME TO MY REPOSITORY**

My name is Aman Mishra and I am a student pursuing Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from Italy. I have recently discovered the path for Data Science and I am exploring it bit by bit(yes in computer terms too..:-p). 

**My Path :**

**1>** Realization of truth: Although it seems a bit obvious that every bachelor's in Computer Science or even a guy pursuing a Master's degree in the same would be good in some programming langugage but it isnt the case for some people . Yes that guy is me ðŸ¦–.
Although I did learn some basic langugages like C++ and Java but they were just cramming up of codes to pass my Bachelor's program. You know how it is in college.
So once I enrolled into a master's course here in italy...Yes,yes,yes ..I came abroad to study Computer Science with much expectations in my shoulders with blank knowledge about the programming but once I attended my first lecture ,Something hard hit my head. Yup that was the shattering of my box of little dreams that i used to dream as i wanted to become some rich ass programmer who earns and spends alot of money (like they show in the movies). I was some kind of a hero going on a quest without the knowledge about how to even fight.

**2>** Journey Begins: I saw my classmates in my class opening up their laptops and starting to convert what the professor asked them into lines of 100-200 line codes and as I watched in horror of how to even install Pycharm into my laptop(sneakingly). As i was googling to "Install Python", I thought maybe I need some help from someone in order to end the endless cycle of shamefulness.
Hence I met my first friend in class Alberto(yes he is italian) and (yes he spoke english..lol its like 1% of total population here who speaks english)..Hmphhh...Anyways ..he told me to install Pycharm because it was the best IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for writing python code and the UI was pretty good too. So i did. But couldnt go any further because what the professor was teaching us was atleast what 2 years practice into coding would look like. So I was very much depressed with what i could have accomplished during the time of my bachelor's degree but wasted in goofing around,playing CS and other stuff too.

I went to the snacks counter and my friend followed me with some of his friends as well joining me into their group. Was kinda awkward as it seemed like i was the first indian guy these guys saw in decades and were treating me strangly. We had coffee together, I bought ofcourse as its in my tradition. We sat down and I just opened up about my problems in coding but they didnt seem to make fun or treat me like a "Coding Noob". They just told me "Open your laptop we 'll show you what you need to learn" . I was just flabbergasted as i couldnt comprehend the generosity and welcomeness these guys showed to help me as i felt like a lost cause once 2 lectures were done.

**3>** Fired Up:
Installed Pycharm
Went to Youtube
Searched for Python tutorial
got 100's of channels teaching the same
luckily got coreyschafer and freecodecamp 
Started with learning
