# LinearRegression_Project

Welcome to my Data Science Project:

This is the first project I have worked on towards my Data Science track. I was inspired by Dhaval who also goes by the name of "codebasics" on Youtube platform. In this model I have taken a dataset from kaggle which has all the property listing prices for the city of Bangalore,India.

I have first worked on getting the best possible model for this project by analysing and testing the data with different models. I have also cleaned the data before feeding it to the model.
In order to get a better insight of working with frontend and backend of a project , I have used this model for better representation with a website using html,css and javascript.
I hope you guys find this project useful. If any doubts,please let me know.
